<p>This module can connect and start different kinds of SAS sessions. It can connect to SAS
on Unix, Mainframe, and Windows. It can connect to a local SAS session or remote session.
Because of the wide range of connection types, there are a number of different access methods
which are used to connect to different kinds of SAS sessions.</p>
<p>The current set of connection methods are as follows:</p>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt><a class="reference internal" href="#stdio">STDIO</a></dt>
<dd>This connection method is available on the Linux platform only. This
method enables you to connect to SAS on the same host as your Python process.</dd>
<dt><a class="reference internal" href="#ssh">SSH</a></dt>
<dd>This connection method (STDIO over SSH) is available from Linux or Windows (or Mac), but only to
SAS on the Linux platform. This  method can connect to SAS that is installed on a remote host,
if you have passwordless SSH configured for your Linux user account.</dd>
<dt><a class="reference internal" href="#iom">IOM</a></dt>
<dd>The Integrated Object Method (IOM) connection method (IOM using Java) supports SAS on any platform.
This method can make a local Windows connection and it is also the way to connect
to SAS Grid through SAS Grid Manager. This method can connect to a SAS Workspace
Server on any supported SAS platform from any client.</dd>
<dt><a class="reference internal" href="#http">HTTP</a></dt>
<dd>This access mehtod uses http[s] to connect to the Compute Service (a micro service) of a Viya
instalation. This does not connet to SAS 9.4 via http. The Compute Service will start a
Compute Server using the SPRE image of MVA SAS that is installed in the Viya deployment.
This is roughly equivalent to a Workspace server via IOM, but in Viya with no SAS 9.4.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="first admonition-title">Note</p>
<p class="last">The COM access method is not fully supported nor as performant as the others.
Please use IOM in place of this, unless you aren&#8217;t concerned with those issues.</p>
</div>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt><a class="reference internal" href="#com">COM</a></dt>
<dd>This connection method (IOM using COM) is for Windows clients connecting to a local or remote SAS 9.4 host. This
method takes advantage of the IOM access method, but does not require a Java dependency.
SAS Enterprise Guide or SAS Integration Technologies Client (a free download from SAS Support)
is required to install the SAS COM library on your client system.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Though there are several connection methods available, a single configuration file
can be used to enable all the connection methods. The sample config file contains instructions and
examples, but this section goes into more detail to explain how to configure each
type of connection.</p>
<p>Depending upon how you did your installation, the sample sascfg.py file may be in different
locations on the file system:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>In a regular pip install, it is under the site-packages directory in the Python
installation.</li>
<li>If you cloned the repo or downloaded and extraced the repo to some directory and then installed,
it will be in that directory and maybe also copied to site-packages.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you are not sure where to look, then there is a very simple way to determine the location
of your saspy installation.</p>
<p>After installing, start Python and <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">import</span> <span class="pre">saspy</span></code>. Then, simply submit <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">saspy</span></code>.
Python will show you where it found the module (it will show the __init__.py file in that directory).
It is the directory that is the module, so the sascfg.py file is in that directory, same as __init__.py.</p>

<div class="section" id="sascfg-personal-py">
<h2>sascfg_personal.py<a class="headerlink" href="#sascfg-personal-py" title="Permalink to this headline">Â¶</a></h2>
<p>Originally, sascfg.py was the config file saspy used. But, since the saspy.cfg file is in the saspy repo, it can be updated
on occasion and when you do an upgrade it will pull down the repo sascfg.py and replace the one
you&#8217;ve in your installation. If you used that file for your configuration, then you would need to keep
a copy elsewhere and then replace the new one with your copy after upgrading or pulling, if yours was replaced.</p>
<p>So, the sascfg.py file bacame the exampls file, and sascfg_personal.py is config file to edit and use.
This file doesn&#8217;t exist in the repo, so it will never be overwritten when you upgrade or pull.
saspy will always try to import sascfg_personal.py first, and only if that fails will it try to
import sascfg.py (only for backwaed compatibility).</p>
<p>So copy sascfg.py to sascfg_personal.py and put all of your specific configuration into the _personal
file. Note that the sascfg.py file has examples of all of the various kinds of connections you could use. You don&#8217;t need
all of that in your _personal version; only the parts you need for your situation. The next section
explains the minimum parts you would need.</p>
<p>Also note that this file does not have to live in the repo itself. It can be anywhere on the filesystem
as long as that location is accessible to python. If the path is in the python search path, then you&#8217;re good.
That includes being in the repo directory, of course, which is the most convenient (that&#8217;s where I have it!).
If it&#8217;s location isn&#8217;t in the python path, you can use the cfgfile=&#8217;&#8217; parm on the SASsession() method to point to it.</p>
<p><strong>New in 3.1.6</strong>: You can now place a sascfg_personal.py configuration file in your home directory. The following
path &#8220;~/.config/saspy/&#8221; will be searched for a sascfg_personal.py file.</p>
<p>The new search order will basically be the same as it has been, but with this new home config directory inserted
after the current dir and before the rest of the python path. The following will be the order in which the config file will
be found.</p>
<p>If you don&#8217;t specify cfgfile= on SASsession, then sascfg_personal.py will be found:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>saspy install directory (same place as the sascfg.py examples file in to repo)</li>
<li>current dir (whatever that is; wherever you started python)</li>
<li>~/.config/saspy - the new directory being added in 3.1.5 (that works on windows too: think %HOMEPATH%\.config\saspy)</li>
<li>the rest of the directories in the python path</li>
<li>if not found, then sascfg.py in the saspy repo (only to support way, way, way back compatibility - don&#8217;t use this)</li>
</ol>
<p>Note that once this has been imported it will be the one config file used for the python session, as it&#8217;s imported by name
so it will be cached and that is what will be used even if imported again.</p>
<p>If you use the cfgfile= to specify a specific file, then that file will be used and no search path will matter.
Note that in the case of cfgfile=, you can use different files for different SASsession()&#8217;s in the python session.
Whatever file you specify for a given SASsession will be used as the config file for that session.</p>
<p>If the configuration file is in the search path described above, you can just create a session as follows:</p>
<div class="highlight-ipython3"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">sas</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">saspy</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">SASsession</span><span class="p">()</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>If, however, it is not in any of those directories, then you can use the cfgfile= parameter in your SASsession() invocation to
specify its location:</p>
<div class="highlight-ipython3"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">sas</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">saspy</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">SASsession</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">cfgfile</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s1">&#39;/some/path/to/your/config/sascfg_personal.py&#39;</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>The python search path can be found by looking at the PYTHONPATH environment variable (if it&#8217;s set),
but more definitively by submitting the following:</p>
<div class="highlight-ipython3"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="kn">import</span> <span class="nn">sys</span>
<span class="n">sys</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">path</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>There are also some new convenience methods and attributes in 3.1.6 to help in the case where you have multiple
sascfg_personal.py files.</p>
<p>First is the saspy.SAScfg attribute which will show you the sascfg_personal.py file that would be used
if you submitted SASsession(). This is found and set when you import saspy.</p>
<p>There is also a saspy.list_configs() method which shows you what sascfg_personal.py files are found in the
search order listed above, in that order.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s an example showing these (I have one in the saspy install dir, current dir and the new ~/.config/saspy dir):</p>
<div class="highlight-ipython3"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">tom</span><span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="n">pwd</span>

<div class="section" id="sascfg-personal-py-details">
<h2>sascfg_personal.py details<a class="headerlink" href="#sascfg-personal-py-details" title="Permalink to this headline">Â¶</a></h2>
<p>There are three main parts to this configuration file.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ol class="arabic simple">
<li>SAS_config_names</li>
<li>SAS_config_options  # this dictionary isn&#8217;t required unless you want to change a default</li>
<li>Configuration definitions</li>
</ol>
</div></blockquote>
<p>In reverse order, the configuration definitions are Python dictionaries. Each dictionary
has the settings for one connection method (STDIO, SSH, IOM, and so on) to a SAS session.
These values are defined in the following sections.</p>
<p>SAS_config_options now has a fourth option (as ov V4.3.2). This new, fourth, option is <cite>style</cite> and
it&#8217;s for setting the ODS Style, overriding the default. There was already an attribute you can set
for this on the SASsession object, <cite>HTML_style</cite>, but that couldn&#8217;t be set in a SAS_Kernel notebook,
so I added it in the config for that case.</p>
<p>The first option <cite>lock_down</cite> restricts (or allows) an end
users&#8217; ability to override settings in the configuration definitions by passing them as parameters
on the <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">SASsession()</span></code>. Each of the keys in the configuration definition can be passed in at
run time on the SASsession(). If lock_down is set to True, any keys defined in the configuration
definition cannot be overridden in SASsession(), Keys that are not specified in the Config Def, can be
specified at run time on the SASsession(). If set to False, any config def key can be specified
on the SASsession().</p>
<p>The second <cite>verbose</cite> controls the printing of some debug type messages. While the third, &#8216;prompt&#8217;
defines whether saspy can prompt the user if necessary. You would set this to False, if running a
script in the background, where no input could be provided and if a prompt were to be issued, the
process would hang waiting on input. Prompt= can also be provided on the SASsession() as a parameter,
though not in the configuration definition, as most prompting that can happen has to do with, and
happens prior to parsing, the configuration definition.</p>
<p>SAS_config_names is the list of configuration definition names to make available to an
end user at connection time. Any configuration definitions that are not listed in
SAS_config_names are simply inaccessible by an end user. You can add several configuration
definitions in the file but not make them available by simply excluding the names from
the list. Also note that these names can be anything you want. The names of the example
configuration definitions we chosen to be self-documenting. There nothing special about &#8216;winlocal&#8217;,
it could be named Bob. But then it wouldn&#8217;t be obvious that it&#8217;s for a WINdows install running a LOCAL copy of SAS.</p>
<p>So, your sascfg_personal.py file only need a few things in it; not everything in the example sascfg.py file.
For example, if you had SAS installed on your Linux system, your sascfg_personal.py file may simply be the following:</p>
<div class="highlight-ipython3"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">SAS_config_names</span>   <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="s1">&#39;mycfg&#39;</span><span class="p">]</span>

<span class="c1"># this is actually optional, you only have to have it to change the defaults</span>
<span class="c1">#SAS_config_options = {&#39;lock_down&#39;: False,</span>
<span class="c1">#                      &#39;verbose&#39;  : True,</span>

<h2>Choosing an Access Method<a class="headerlink" href="#choosing-an-access-method" title="Permalink to this headline">Â¶</a></h2>
<p>How do you know how to configure SASPy? Well, the first thing is to know is what SAS
instance you are trying to connect to. Next is where are you connecting to it from - what
client are you running SASPy on? These two answers will dictate which access method you
will use and thus what your configuration definition will contain.</p>
<div class="highlight-default"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>What kind of SAS deployment, and where?
    a. Stand-alone SAS 9 install
        i. On Linux

<p>Now you can go to the access method specific configuration below to
see what you&#8217;ll need for your configuration definition.There are also example
configuration definitions in the example configuration file, sascfg.py, showing each of these
different cases.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="stdio">
<h2>STDIO<a class="headerlink" href="#stdio" title="Permalink to this headline">Â¶</a></h2>
<p>This is the original access method. This works with Unix only,
because SAS on Windows platforms does not support line-mode style connections
(through stdin, stdout, stderr). This connection method is for a local
connection to SAS that is installed on the same host as Python.</p>
<p>There are only four keys for this configuration definition dictionary:</p>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>saspath -</dt>
<dd>(Required) Path to SAS startup script</dd>
<dt>options -</dt>
<dd>SAS options to include in the start up command line. These <strong>must</strong> be a
Python list.</dd>
<dt>encoding -</dt>
<dd><p class="first">NOTE: as of saspy V2.4.2, you no longer need to set the encoding. SASpy
will determine the SAS session encoding and map that to the Python encoding for you.</p>
<p class="last">This is the Python encoding value that matches the SAS session encoding
of the SAS session to which you are connecting. The Python encoding
values can be found at <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.python.org/3.5/library/codecs.html#encodings-and-unicode">encodings-and-unicode</a>.
The three most common SAS encodings, UTF8, LATIN1, and WLATIN1 are the
default encodings for running SAS in Unicode, on Unix, and on Windows,
respectively. Those map to Python encoding values: utf8, latin1, and
windows-1252, respectively.</p>
</dd>
<dt>autoexec -</dt>
<dd>This is a string of SAS code that will be submitted upon establishing a connection.
You can use this to preassign libraries you always want available, or whatever you want.
Don&#8217;t confuse this with the autoexec option of SAS which specifies a sas program file to be run.
That is different. This is a string of SAS code saspy will submit after the session is created,
which would be after SAS already included any autoexec file if there was one.</dd>
<dt>lrecl -</dt>
<dd>An integer specifying the record length for transferring wide data sets from SAS to Data Frames.</dd>
<dt>display -</dt>
<dd>This is a new key to support Zeppelin (saspy V2.4.4). The values can be either &#8216;jupyter&#8217; or &#8216;zeppelin&#8217;,
or, as of version 3.1.7, &#8216;databricks&#8217;. The default when this is not specified is &#8216;jupyter&#8217;.
Jupyter uses IPython to render HTML, which is how saspy has always worked.
To support other Notebooks display methods, different display interface have to be added to saspy.
If you want to run saspy in Zeppelin, set this in your configuration definition: &#8216;display&#8217; : &#8216;zeppelin&#8217;,</dd>
<dt>m5dsbug -</dt>
<dd>This is a new key, as of version 3.1.9, to address a bug in the data step in the M5 maintenance release.
This bug affects the code generated in the sasdata2dataframe method of this access method. It&#8217;s only
is a problem if connected to SAS 9.4M5 and if the data set has multi-byte data. Setting this
key to True will cause different code to be generated to work around this problem. See the description
of V3.1.9 here for more info: <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/sassoftware/saspy/releases/tag/v3.1.9">https://github.com/sassoftware/saspy/releases/tag/v3.1.9</a></dd>

</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ssh">
<h2>SSH<a class="headerlink" href="#ssh" title="Permalink to this headline">Â¶</a></h2>
<p>aka: STDIO over SSH</p>
<p>NEW in V3.6.3, you can use this method from a Windows Client to connect to a
stand alone SAS install on a remote Linux machine. Before that, it was only supported
from a Linux client.</p>
<p>This is the remote version of the original connection method. This also works
with Unix SAS only, and it supports passwordless SSH to the Unix machine where SAS
is installed. It is up to you to make sure that user accounts have passwordless
SSH configured between the two systems. Starting in version 4.3.0, you can use sshpass
on Linux to automate connecting with user/password as an option instead of a passwordless
configuration.</p>
<p>If you don&#8217;t already have this set up, you need to generate rsa keys. Starting
after version 2.2.9, you can specify an identity file (.pem file) instead by
providing the file path on the identity key. Either of these provide passwordless access.
If you have any trouble with this, you will find that adding -vvv to the command saspy
trys to run (run that yourself from a shell with -vvv added) will provide significant
diagnostics about how ssh is trying to authenticate. Something like the following:</p>
<p>/usr/bin/ssh -vvv hostname.to.connect.to</p>
<p>In addition to the keys for STDIO, there are two more keys to configure:</p>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>ssh -</dt>
<dd>(Required) The ssh command to run (Linux execv requires a fully qualified
path. Even if the command is found in the PATH variable, it won&#8217;t be used.
Enter the fully qualified path.)</dd>
<dt>host -</dt>
<dd>(Required) The host to connect to. Enter a resolvable host name or IP address.</dd>

<p class="last">The <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">'ssh'</span></code> key is the trigger to use the STDIO over SSH connection
method.</p>
</div>
<p>To accomodate alternative SSH configurations, you may also provide any of the
following optional keys:</p>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>identity -</dt>
<dd>(Optional: string) The path to the identity file to use. A .pem file.</dd>
<dt>luser -</dt>
<dd>(Optional: string) New in V3.6.3 for Win support. Linux user name to use for the connection. This will generate
&#8216;ssh -xyz <a class="reference external" href="mailto:user&#37;&#52;&#48;linux&#46;host&#46;com">user<span>&#64;</span>linux<span>&#46;</span>host<span>&#46;</span>com</a>&#8216; instead of &#8216;ssh -xyz linux.host.com&#8217; in case your windows userid isn&#8217;t
the same as the Linux id on the SAS server (mine&#8217;s not); if it is, you don&#8217;t need this. You could use the identity option,
above, too. Just another choice.</dd>
<dt>port -</dt>
<dd>(Optional: integer) The ssh port of the remote machine (equivalent to invoking ssh with the <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">-p</span></code> option).
Obviously, 22 is the default</dd>
<dt>tunnel -</dt>
<dd>(Optional: integer) Certain methods of saspy require opening a local port and accepting a connection and data
streamed from the SAS instance to saspy. If the remote SAS server would not be able to reach ports on your client machine
due to a firewall or other security configuration, you may pass a port number to used for SAS to connect to on
the remote side, which will be forwarded to the local side (using the <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">-R</span></code> ssh option) so that the remote SAS
server can connect using this port.</dd>
<dt>rtunnel -</dt>
<dd>(Optional: integer) Certain methods of saspy require opening a remote port and allowing a connection to be made and
data streamed to the SAS server from saspy; the Reverse of the tunnel case. In these cases, saspy needs to provide
a port for the SAS server to use to accept a connection so data can be streamed to the SAs server.
This is simply the reverse of the tunnel case, where SAS creates the socket and saspy connects. This will use
the <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">-L</span></code> ssh option so that the saspy can connect to the remote SAS server on this port.</dd>
<dt>localhost -</dt>
<dd>This is a rarely needed options for providing the ip of the client machine (where SASPy/python is running).
Normally this is resolved by gethostname() but in the case where the ip from that isn&#8217;t correct, you can
override it by providing the ip here. The only case this has been seen is on a home network with no domains
nor dns, such that a local machine name (&#8216;MyPC&#8217;) ends up resolved to some arbitrary internet ip
(i.e.: 128.64.32.16), not the actual local ip (i.e.: 10.0.0.10).</dd>
<dt>sshpass -</dt>
<dd>This is the fully qualified path of the sshpass command. the <cite>ssh</cite> key is still required, as ssh is still being
executed and has to be in the full command. But this allows the use of user/pw connections instead of rsa keys.</dd>
<dt>sshpassparms -</dt>
<dd>This is a Python List containing the parms you want to use for sshpass. The three primary choinces are to provide
the password on the command line (it&#8217;s xxx&#8217;ed out when looking at the system processes), or from a file or from an
environment variable. Check the man page on sshpass. ie: &#8216;sshpassparms&#8217; : [&#8216;-f&#8217;, &#8216;/file/with/pw/in/it&#8217;]</dd>

At the time of this writing (SASPy V3.7.8), 2.16.0 was the current newest release that fixed these, and 2.12.2 was added
to address them in a version that still supports Java 7. SASPy still provides support for Java 7 so both
2.12.2 and 2.16.0 are included in the SASPy deployment. SASPy configures the classpath by default and uses
the 2.12.2 jars to maintain compatibility with Java 7. There is a new configuration definition key, &#8216;log4j&#8217;,
that can be used to cause SASPy to use the 2.16.0 version instead. If there is another version you want to
use, it can be done by providing the &#8216;classpath&#8217; key to override the classpath SASPy would generate, specifying
whichever log4j jar file you want to use (you have to provide the files themselves). Note that if doing this, you
should use the same classpath as SASPy generates, just replacing the log4j jar files with the ones you
want to use.</p>
<p>Also note that SASPy does NOT expose any of the log4j vulnerabilities because it doesn&#8217;t use log4j and doesn&#8217;t
even initialize it in its Java process it spawns for the IOM client. So none of the various log4j vulnerabilities
are exposed via the SASPy client.</p>

<h3>ATTN, as of saspy version 3.3.3, the classpath is no longer required in your configuration file!<a class="headerlink" href="#attn-as-of-saspy-version-3-3-3-the-classpath-is-no-longer-required-in-your-configuration-file" title="Permalink to this headline">Â¶</a></h3>
<p>The 4 required IOM Java client jars are now included in the saspy repo, and they, along with the saspyiom.jar and the
thirdparty CORBA jars will be automatically provided as the calsspath by saspy. This is generally all that is needed.
If you require the 3 encryption jars, shown below, they still need to be acquired from your SAS deployment, and then
put in the saspy/java/iomclient directory of the saspy install (where the 4 included jars are) so they will be included
in the classpath for you.</p>
<p>Note that for AES encryption, at least prior to SAS 9.4M7, Java 8 (release greater than 151), has the needed
support in it, so if your workspace server is configured for AES, just having a current version of Java 8 or
higher will allow it to work, without needing the 3 encryption jars. That doesn&#8217;t work w/ M7 however, so you
would need the encryption jars when connecting to M7.</p>
<p>The 3 encryption jars, if needed, can be found in a SAS deployment in a location similar to, but not exactly the
sam as, the following. If you get any error about encryption, adding these 3 jars is the proper way to address it.</p>

<h3>The .authinfo file (_authinfo on Windows)<a class="headerlink" href="#the-authinfo-file-authinfo-on-windows" title="Permalink to this headline">Â¶</a></h3>
<p>The IOM and HTTP access methods have support for getting the required user/password from an authinfo file in the user&#8217;s home directory
instead of prompting for it. On linux, the file is named .authinfo and on windows, it&#8217;s _authinfo. The format of the line in the authinfo file is
as follows. The first value is the authkey value you specify for <cite>authkey</cite>. Next is the &#8216;user&#8217; key followed by the value (the user id)
and then &#8216;password&#8217; key followed by its value (the user&#8217;s password). Note that there are permission rules for this file. On linux the file must
have permissions of 600, only the user can read or write the file. On Windows, the file should be equally locked down to where only the owner
can read and write it. Also, the encoding of this file should be UTF-8, or any encoding that has ASCII as it&#8217;s low order 7-bits if you only
use those characters in the file. It&#8217;s read into Python as is, and thus is expected to be utf-8.</p>

</div>
<p>The authinfo file in the home directory for user Bob, with a password of BobsPW1 would have a line in it as follows:</p>

<h3>Remote<a class="headerlink" href="#remote" title="Permalink to this headline">Â¶</a></h3>
<p>A remote connection is defined as a connection to any Workspace Server on any SAS platform
from either a Unix or Windows client. This module does not connect to a SAS Metadata Server (OMR),
but rather connects directly to an Object Spawner to get access to a Workspace Server. If you already
access these with other SAS clients, like Enterprise Guide (EG), you may already be familiar with
connecting to OMR, but not directly to the others by host/port. There is information in the
<a class="reference internal" href="advanced-topics.html"><span class="doc">Advanced topics</span></a> section about using Proc iomoperate to find Object Spawners and Workspace
Server to get values for the three keys defined below (iomhost, iomport, appserver).</p>
<p>The following keys are available for the configuration definition dictionary:</p>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>java    -</dt>
<dd>(Required) The path to the Java executable to use. For Linux, use a fully qualifed
path. On Windows, you might be able to simply enter <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">java</span></code>. If that is not successful,
enter the fully qualified path.</dd>
<dt>iomhost -</dt>
<dd>(Required) The resolvable host name, or IP address to the IOM object spawner.
New in 2.1.6; this can be a list of all the object spawners hosts if you have load balanced object spawners.
This provides Grid HA (High Availability)</dd>
<dt>iomport -</dt>
<dd>(Required) The port that object spawner is listening on for workspace server connections (workspace server port - not object spawner port!).</dd>
<dt>log4j -</dt>
<dd>SASPy, as of V4.0.0 now uses V2.12.4 log4j (by default) to mitigate the vulnerabilities found in Dec 2021. V2.17.1 is also included
in the deployment, but it doesn&#8217;t support Java 7. &#8216;2.12.4&#8217; and &#8216;2.17.1&#8217; are the 2 valid values for this key, to chose which version to use.</dd>
<dt>classpath -</dt>
<dd>(No longer Required) As of V3.3.3 this is no longer required. See instuctions above (ATTN, as of saspy version 3.3.3, the classpath is no longer required!)
Note that you can still provide this and override the classpath SASPy generates, but that is not recommended under any normal circumstance.</dd>
<dt>authkey -</dt>
<dd>The keyword that starts a line in the authinfo file containing user and or password for this connection.</dd>
<dt>omruser -</dt>
<dd>(<strong>Discouraged</strong>)  The user ID is required but if this field is left blank,
the user is <strong>prompted</strong> for a user ID at runtime, unless it&#8217;s found in the authinfo file.</dd>
<dt>omrpw  -</dt>
<dd>(<strong>Strongly discouraged</strong>) A password is required but if this field is left
blank, the user is <strong>prompted</strong> for a password at runtime, unless it&#8217;s found in the authinfo file.</dd>
<dt>encoding  -</dt>
<dd><p class="first">NOTE: as of saspy V2.4.2, you no longer need to set the encoding. SASpy
will determine the SAS session encoding and map that to the Python encoding for you.
You can set this to eliminate the message, at connection time, about what encoding was determined.</p>
<p class="last">This is the Python encoding value that matches the SAS session encoding of
the IOM server to which you are connecting. The Python encoding values can be
found at <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.python.org/3.5/library/codecs.html#encodings-and-unicode">encodings-and-unicode</a>.
The three most common SAS encodings, UTF8, LATIN1, and WLATIN1 are the
default encodings for running SAS in Unicode, on Unix, and on Windows,
respectively. Those map to Python encoding values: utf8, latin1, and
windows-1252, respectively.</p>
</dd>
<dt>timeout -</dt>
<dd>Timeout value for establishing connection to workspace server</dd>
<dt>appserver -</dt>
<dd>If you have more than one AppServer defined on OMR, then you must pass the name of the physical workspace server
that you want to connect to, i.e.: &#8216;SASApp - Workspace Server&#8217;. Without this the Object spawner will only try the
first one in the list of app servers it supports.</dd>
<dt>sspi -</dt>
<dd>New in 2.17, there is support for IWA (Integrated Windows Authentication) from a Windows client to remote IOM server.
This is only for when your Workspace server is configured to use IWA as the authentication method, which is not the default.
This is simply a boolean, so to use it you specify &#8216;sspi&#8217; : True. Also, to use this, you must have the path to the
spiauth.dll file in your System Path variable, just like is required for Local IOM connections.
See the second paragraph under Local IOM for more on the spiauth.dll file.</dd>
<dt>autoexec -</dt>
<dd>This is a string of SAS code that will be submitted upon establishing a connection.
You can use this to preassign libraries you always want available, or whatever you want.
Don&#8217;t confuse this with the autoexec option of SAS which specifies a sas program file to be run.
That is different. This is a string of SAS code saspy will submit after the session is created,
which would be after SAS already included any autoexec file if there was one.</dd>
<dt>javaparms -</dt>
<dd>The javaparms option allows you to specify Java command line options. These aren&#8217;t generally needed, but this
does allows for a way to specify them if something was needed.</dd>
<dt>lrecl -</dt>
<dd>An integer specifying the record length for transferring wide data sets from SAS to Data Frames.</dd>
<dt>display -</dt>
<dd>This is a new key to support Zeppelin (saspy V2.4.4). The values can be either &#8216;jupyter&#8217; or &#8216;zeppelin&#8217;,
or, as of version 3.1.7, &#8216;databricks&#8217;. The default when this is not specified is &#8216;jupyter&#8217;.
Jupyter uses IPython to render HTML, which is how saspy has always worked.
To support other Notebooks display methods, different display interface have to be added to saspy.
If you want to run saspy in Zeppelin, set this in your configuration definition: &#8216;display&#8217; : &#8216;zeppelin&#8217;,</dd>
<dt>logbufsz -</dt>
<dd>see issue 266 for details on this. not needed normally</dd>
<dt>m5dsbug -</dt>
<dd>This is a new key, as of version 3.1.9, to address a bug in the data step in the M5 maintenance release.
This bug affects the code generated in the sasdata2dataframe method of this access method. It&#8217;s only
is a problem if connected to SAS 9.4M5 and if the data set has multi-byte data. Setting this
key to True will cause different code to be generated to work around this problem. See the description

<p>A local connection is defined as a connection to SAS that is running on the same

specify any of the others).</p>
<p><strong>There is one additional requirement.</strong> The sspiauth.dll file&#8211;also included in
your SAS installation&#8211;must be in your system PATH environment variable, your
java.library.path, or in the home directory of your Java client. You can search
for this file in your SAS deployment, though it is likely
in SASHome\SASFoundation\9.4\core\sasext.</p>
<p>If you add this to the system PATH environment variable, only list the path to
the directory&#8211;do not include the file itself. For example:</p>

<p>An alternative to puting this directory in your PATH, is to add it at runtime. You can add this

<p>Yes, you can even connect to a SAS server running on MVS (Mainframe SAS).
There are a couple of requirements for this to work right. First, you need version 2.1.5 or higher of this module.
There were a couple tweaks I needed to make to the IOM access method and those are in 2.1.5.</p>
<p>Also, you need to use the HFS file system for the WORK (and/or USER) library and you also need to set the default file
system to HFS so temporary files used by this module use HFS instead of the native MVS file system. You can still access
the native file system in the code you run, but for internal use, this module needs to access the HFS file system.
To set the default file system (options filesystem=hfs;) you can either set it in the workspace severs config file,
or you can submit the options statement from your python code after making a connection:</p>
<div class="highlight-default"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">sas</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">saspy</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">SASsession</span><span class="p">()</span>

<p>The other thing is to set the encoding correctly for this to work. MVS is an EBCDIC system, not ASCII. For the most part,
this is all handled in IOM for you, but for data transfer routines, transcoding is required. The default encoding on MVS
is OPEN_ED-1047, although it can be set to any number of other EBCDIC encodings. The default Python encodings do not include
the 1047 code page. I did find a &#8216;cp1047&#8217; code page in a separate pip installable module which seems to match the OPEN_ED-1047
code page. So if you&#8217;re running with that encoding, you can install the cp1047 to use.</p>

<h2>HTTP<a class="headerlink" href="#http" title="Permalink to this headline">Â¶</a></h2>
<p>This is the access method for Viya. It does not connect to SAS 9.4. This access method accesses the Compute (micro) Service
of a SAS Viya deployment. The Compute Service launches Compute Servers, which are MVA SAS sessions found in the SPRE deployment
of the Viya installation. This is the equivalent of an IOM Workspace server, but in a Viya deployment.
So, it is still connecting to MVA SAS and all of the methods behave the same as they would with any other saspy access method.</p>
<p>Authentication:</p>
<p>There are continuing to be new ways invented to authenticate to Viya. Originally it was user/pw like anything else. More
recently, an SSO method was created. More recently than that is integration w/ Azure, providing the ability to pass
an Azure token in, to get a Viya token. Actually, this method should allow any JWT Bearer Token to be passed in and used,
assuming it&#8217;s configured to be valid in Viya. The various configuration keys are provided below, but I wanted to identify
them here, as they are mutually exclusive. You use only one of the various means to authenticate.</p>
<ol class="arabic">
<li><p class="first">user/pw</p>
<p>the keys for this are either &#8216;user&#8217; and &#8216;pw&#8217;, or use &#8216;authkey&#8217; to identify them from in an authinfo file.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">SSO</p>
<p>The primary key in &#8216;authcode&#8217; which is a onetime token acquired from a call to SASLogon, as a two factor authentication scheme.
The &#8216;client_id&#8217; and &#8216;client_secret&#8217; are also required, although a special client_id has been created by default in Viya deployments
for SASPy, and I will default to that unless you provide other client info that an administrator created and provided you to use.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Azure JWT (actually, any JWT perhaps, in the future)</p>
<p>&#8216;jwt&#8217; is the key to provide that non-Viya Bearer Token, to then pass through to SASLogon to get the Viya Bearer Token to use.
And these tokens, are just big long strings; thoussnads of bytes long strings of random characters
(so you know you&#8217;re passing in the right thing).</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">SASLogon Authentication Token</p>
<p>All of the previous authentication mechanisms are used to acquire the Viya Auth Token. You can, actually, do all of that yourself
via various Rest API&#8217;s. If you do that, then you can just pass in the Viya Auth Token, and I&#8217;ll skip the auth process and just
use that token; Bob&#8217;s your uncle, as they say. The key for this is &#8216;authtoken&#8217;.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Again, only use one of these and don&#8217;t mix using config keys from more than one for a given connection.</p>
<p>The keys for this configuration definition dictionary are:</p>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>url -</dt>
<dd>(Required if ip not specified) The URL to Viya, of the form &#8216;http[s]://host.identifier[:port]&#8217;. When this is specified,
ip= will not be used, as the host&#8217;s ip is retrieved from the url. Also, ssl= is set based upon http or https and port=
is also parsed from the url, if provided, else defaulted based upon the derived ssl= value. So neither ip, port nor ssl
are needed when url= is used.</dd>
<dt>ip -</dt>
<dd>[Deprecated] (Required if url not specified) The resolvable host name, or IP address to the Viya Compute Service</dd>
<dt>port -</dt>
<dd>[Deprecated] The port to use to connect to the Compute Service. This will default to either 80 or 443 based upon the ssl key.</dd>
<dt>ssl -</dt>
<dd>[Deprecated] (Optional) Boolean identifying whether to use HTTPS (ssl=True) or just HTTP. The default is True and will default to port 443 if
the port is not specified. If set to False, it will default to port 80, if the port is not specified.
Note that depending upon the version of python, certificate verification may or may not be required, later version are more strict.
See the python doc for your version if this is a concern.</dd>
<dt>verify -</dt>
<dd>(Optional) Also note that if Viya uses the default self signed ssl certificates it ships with, you will not be able to verify them,
but that can be fine, and you can still use an ssl connection. You can use set &#8216;verify&#8217; : False, in your config to
turn off verification for this case.</dd>
<dt>client_id -</dt>
<dd>[for SSO Viya configurations] client_id to use for authenticating to Viya (defaults to &#8216;SASPy&#8217;)</dd>
<dt>client_secret -</dt>
<dd>[for SSO Viya configurations] client_secret to use for authenticating to Viya (defaults to &#8216;&#8217;)</dd>
<dt>authcode -</dt>
<dd>[for SSO Viya configurations] one time authorization code acquired via the SASLogon oauth service
where the url to get the code would be [url]/SASLogon/oauth/authorize?client_id=[client_id]&amp;response_type=code
so perhaps:        <a class="reference external" href="https://SAS.Viya.sas.com/SASLogon/oauth/authorize?client_id=SASPy&amp;response_type=code">https://SAS.Viya.sas.com/SASLogon/oauth/authorize?client_id=SASPy&amp;response_type=code</a></dd>
<dt>authkey -</dt>
<dd>(Optional) The keyword that starts a line in the authinfo file containing user and or password for this connection. See the IOM using Java above for more info.</dd>
<dt>user -</dt>
<dd>(<strong>Discouraged</strong>)  The user ID is required but if this field is left blank,
the user is <strong>prompted</strong> for a user ID at runtime, unless it&#8217;s found in the authinfo file.</dd>
<dt>pw  -</dt>
<dd>(<strong>Strongly discouraged</strong>) A password is required but if this field is left
blank, the user is <strong>prompted</strong> for a password at runtime, unless it&#8217;s found in the authinfo file.</dd>
<dt>context -</dt>
<dd>The Compute Service has different Contexts that you can connect to. Think Appserver in IOM.
if you don&#8217;t provide one here, saspy will query the Service upon connecting and get a list of available Contexts and
prompt you for which one to use.</dd>
<dt>timeout -</dt>
<dd>(Optional) HTTPConnection timeout value, in seconds. Defaults to None. This is passed to HTTPConnection;
it&#8217;s not part of the Viya API but rather the http.client API.</dd>
<dt>inactive -</dt>
<dd>(Optional) An integer specifying the Inactive Time Out in minutes for the Compute Session. This is a SAS
Compute Service option and controls when the Compute Service self terminates based upon inactivity. The regular
Compute Session default timeout is 15 minutes, but for SASPy, I default this to 120 minutes. So, you likely won&#8217;t
need to provide this yourself. The Session is already explicitly terminated when your Python process ends or you issue endsas()</dd>
<dt>options -</dt>
<dd>(Optional) SAS options to include when connecting. These <strong>must</strong> be a Python list.</dd>
<dt>encoding -</dt>
<dd>(Ignored)
Unlike the other access methods, the HTTP API to the Compute Service uses UTF-8 for all calls.
So, no transcoding is necessary, nor done, on the Python side, so this option is not needed and ignored.</dd>
<dt>autoexec -</dt>
<dd>(Optional) This is a string of SAS code that will be submitted upon establishing a connection.
You can use this to preassign libraries you always want available, or whatever you want.
Don&#8217;t confuse this with the autoexec option of SAS which specifies a sas program file to be run.
That is different. This is a string of SAS code saspy will submit after the session is created,
which would be after SAS already included any autoexec file if there was one.</dd>
<dt>lrecl -</dt>
<dd>(Optional) An integer specifying the record length for transferring wide data sets from SAS to Data Frames.</dd>
<dt>display -</dt>
<dd>This is a new key to support Zeppelin (saspy V2.4.4). The values can be either &#8216;jupyter&#8217; or &#8216;zeppelin&#8217;,
or, as of version 3.1.7, &#8216;databricks&#8217;. The default when this is not specified is &#8216;jupyter&#8217;.
Jupyter uses IPython to render HTML, which is how saspy has always worked.
To support other Notebooks display methods, different display interface have to be added to saspy.
If you want to run saspy in Zeppelin, set this in your configuration definition: &#8216;display&#8217; : &#8216;zeppelin&#8217;,</dd>
<dt>authtoken -</dt>
<dd>The SASLogon authorization token to use instead of acquiring one via user/pw or authcode or jwt.
Normally SASPy calls SASLogon to authenticate and get this token. But, if you do that yourself, you can just pass it in.
These tokens, for reference, are very long strings of random chatacters; just so you know that
you&#8217;re using the right thing :)</dd>
<dt>jwt -</dt>
<dd>A JWT bearer token that can be used to acquire a SASLogon authorization token. This would be something like an Azure
token, where Azure and Viya have been set up to allow the JWT to be used to get a SASLogon token.
These tokens, for reference, are very long strings of random chatacters; just so you know that
you&#8217;re using the right thing :)</dd>

<p>New in 3.1.0, this user contributed access method uses Windows COM to connect to the SAS IOM provider. It is similar to the other IOM access method,
but there is no Java dependency. Connections from Windows clients to local and remote SAS 9.4 hosts are supported.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="first admonition-title">Note</p>

of the functionality and performance characteristics in this access method that I provide in the other access methods I wrote. There have been lots of improvements
since this was contributed, many of which I couldn&#8217;t factor into this method. The IOM access method is the preferred, fully supported method, but you can use
this if it does what you need from it.</p>
</div>
<p>SAS Enterprise Guide or SAS Integration Technologies Client (a free download from SAS support) is required to install the SAS COM library on your client system.</p>
<p>The COM access method requires a Python module that saspy, in general, does not; pypiwin32  If you do not have this already installed before trying to use the COM
access method, you will likely see an error similar to this when trying to establish a connection. Just install that modules to solve this.</p>
